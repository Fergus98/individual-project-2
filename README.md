# individual-project-2

# Introduction 

This project saw the development of a basic account and prize generator. It is made up of four individual services: A random 4 digit number generator, a random 4 letter generator, a service which concatenates the two and finally the flask application that displays this result. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the dockerization of a project split into microservices.

# Sprint 4 Board

This final sprint board shows that three tasks were not completed.  Creating a webpage for account tracking was only of Would priority and does not impact the final product significantly. Then the second database with prizes was of Could priority so similarly is not too impactful that it is not in the project. Finally we have creating the database service. This was of Must priority, I had the minimum viable product in mind and decided last minute due to difficulties with the database service to remove it from the project as I deemed it non essential.

# Discussion

During this project I encountered a variety of problems that changed the final product. Firstly I did not expect the configuration of the Playbook.yaml to take as much time as it did.
