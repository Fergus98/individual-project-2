# Introduction 

This project saw the development of a basic account and prize generator. It is made up of four individual services: A random 4 digit number generator, a random 4 letter generator, a service which concatenates the two and finally the flask application that displays this result. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the dockerization of a project split into microservices.
